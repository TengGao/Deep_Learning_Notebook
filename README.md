This is my personal notes on both machine learning and deep learning topics. Since the topics are vast and there are too many source to keep track of, plus other people reference may use both coding and writing style that are difficult for me to read, I decided to put many of the good reading material, and/or core concepts that I found are importand, necessary or interesting to me into one place. Additionally, this is also a good excercise for me to be more indepth with these concepts.

 Let's break this note into three sections:
- Statistical concept;
- Machine learning concepts;
- Deep learning concepts;
